'exd 5 Now that we know the commands let's take a look at an example of adding a command with 'exa , \u00b6 'exadd \"Nice Weather\" It sure is, %user%! This command can be split into two different arguments: The trigger, \"Nice Weather\" And the response, It sure is, %user%! An important thing to note about the triger is that, to be more than one word, we had to wrap it with quotation marks, \"Like this\" otherwise, only the first word would have been recognised as the trigger, and the second word would have been recognised as part of the response. There's no special requirement for the formatting of the response, so we could just write it in exactly the same way we want it to respond, albeit with a placeholder - which will be explained in this next section. Now, if that command was ran in a server, anyone on that server can make the bot mention them, saying It sure is, @Username anytime they say \"Nice Weather\". If the command is ran in a direct message with the bot, then the expression can be used on every server the bot is connected to. Block global Expressions \u00b6 If you want to disable a global expression which you do not like, and you do not want to remove it, or you are not the bot owner, you can do so by adding a new expression with the same trigger on your server, and set the response to - .

In this guide we will be explaining how to use the permission commands correctly and even cover a few common questions ! Every command we discuss here can be found in the Commands List . Why do we use the Permissions Commands? \u00b6 Permissions are very handy at setting who can use what commands in a server. All commands and modules are enabled by default. If something is a bot owner only command, it can only be ran by the bot owner Several commands still require that you have the correct permissions on Discord to be able to use them, so for users to be able to use commands like 'kick and 'voicemute , they need Kick and Mute Members server permissions, respectively. With the permissions system it possible to restrict who can skip the current song, pick NadekoFlowers or use the NSFW module. First Time Setup \u00b6 To change permissions you must meet the following requirements: Have Administrator Server Permission. If you are NOT the server owner or an admin, get the role set to 'permrole (there is no permission role by default). Basics & Hierarchy \u00b6 The Commands List is a great tool which lists all available commands, however we'll go over a few of them here. First, let's explain how the permissions system works - It's simple once you figure out how each command works! The permissions system works as a chain. Everytime a command is used, the permissions chain is checked. Starting from the top of it, the command is compared to a rule, if it isn't either allowed or disallowed by that rule it proceeds to check the next rule all the way till it reaches the bottom rule, which allows all commands. To view this permissions chain, do 'lp . The rule at the top of the chain takes priority over all rules below it. If you want to remove a permission from the chain of permissions, do 'rp X to remove rule number X and similarly, do 'mp X Y to move rule number X to number Y (moving, not swapping!). If you want the bot to notify users why they can't use a command or module, use 'verbose true and Ellie will tell you what rule is preventing the command from being used. Commonly Asked Questions \u00b6 How do I restrict all commands to a single channel? \u00b6 To allow users to only use commands in a specific text channel, follow these steps: 'asm disable Disables all modules on the entire server 'acm enable #bot-spammerino Enables all modules in the #bot-spammerino channel How do I allow only one module to be used in a specific channel? \u00b6 To allow users to only use commands from a certain module, let's say gambling , in a specific text channel, follow these steps: 'acm disable #gamblers-den Disables all modules in the #gamblers-den channel 'cm Gambling enable #gamblers-den Enables usage of the Gambling module in the #gamblers-den channel How do I create a music DJ? \u00b6 To allow users to only see the current song and have a DJ role for queuing follow these steps: 'sm Music disable Disables music commands for everybody 'sc .nowplaying enable Enables the \"nowplaying\" command for everyone 'sc .listqueue enable Enables the \"listqueue\" command for everyone 'rm Music enable DJ Enables all music commands only for the DJ role How do I create a NSFW role? \u00b6 Say you want to only enable NSFW commands for a specific role, just do the following two steps.
